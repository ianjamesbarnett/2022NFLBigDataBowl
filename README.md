This repo corresponds to my submission to the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl.
Note that to run the code on colab you need to have the data on google drive to read in.

1) nextposFFNN.ipnb: This code is used to process the data into field states and Model A is trained and stored for later use.
2) retyardFFNN.ipnb: This code is used to train Model B and store for later use.
3) calcCOYOTEv2.ipnb: This code is used to calculate the COYOTE/ret statistic using the stored trained network parameters for Models A and B.
